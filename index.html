<h2 id="rideCount">About: This is a data visualization for total rides per month during 2017. The data has been exported from zagster-service.herokuapp.com and expressed visually with chart.js. The jquery library was used to support the chart, and CSS and HTML were used to make it look visually appealing. And finally, JSON took the data from the database and put it into my chart.</h2>
